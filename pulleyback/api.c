/* Transactions are somewhat complex, also because they are implicitly
 * started when changes are made using _add(), _del() or _reset().
 * These operations may be conditional in the calling program, and we
 * want to aliviete the burden of maintaining a state as to whether
 * a transaction has been started implicitly, so we accept calls to
 * _prepare(), _rollback() or _commit() when no transaction exists
 * yet.  We will implement such occurrences equivalently to opening a
 * new transaction and acting on it immediately (though the logs may
 * not show it if we can optimise by not actually doing it -- it is
 * much simpler to skip the _rollback() or _commit() on an empty
 * transaction.
 *
 * We use txn_state to maintain state between _prepare() and its followup
 * call; the followup may be _prepare(), which is idempotent and will
 * return the same result; it may be _commit(), but only when the
 * preceding _prepare() has reported success; or it may be _rollback(),
 * regardless of the state reported by _prepare().
 *
 * Invalid sequences are reported through assert() -- which is not a
 * bug but a facility!  It helps the plugin user to code transaction
 * logic correctly.  The implicitness of transactions means that we
 * cannot capture all logic failures though.
