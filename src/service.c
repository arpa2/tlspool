/* The data stored in this module consists of lists of sockets to listen to
 * for connection setup and command exchange, but not data communication.
 * Commands are received from the various clients and processed, always
 * ensuring exactly one reply.
 * 
 * Some command requests are actually callbacks in reaction to something
 * the TLS pool sent to an application.  Those callbacks are recognised
 * by their pio_cbid parameter, and after security scrutiny they are passed
 * on directly to the requester, bypassing normal command processing and
 * instead processing it where it was requested.  This parser-like spread
 * of acceptable cases over processing nodes simplifies the complexity
 * and available alternatives in each node.  It also helps to benefit from
 * overlap between (semantics versions of) similar commands.
 *
 * Anything that may take up more than a trivial amount of time (perhaps
 * because it must wait for remote operations to complete) is sent off to
 * a separate thread, which may interact with its client or with a client
 * serving a special purpose (that is, the PIN entry client).
 *
 * When a thread wants to request a callback, it sends a command response
 * to that end, after creating a suitable structure in the callback list.
 * This structure includes a place where the callback command can be
 * stored, and a mutex that must be unlocked when that has been done.  The
 * callback structure may at that point be released.  The structures for
 * these exchanges with the callback list and, complicating matters, the
 * free list of callback structures, is arranged in this module and offered
 * to the rest of the TLS pool as an abstract service.
