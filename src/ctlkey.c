/* tlspool/ctlkey.c -- Control Key Registry
 *
 * The control key registry is a tree-shaped storage structure for ctlkey
 * values.  Basically, a pthread registers its control key for as long as
 * it is open to external parties claiming it; a claim will be translated
 * to a SIGINT to the registering pthread, which will leave its pselect()
 * and add the newly offered file descriptor.
 *
 * This tree remains balanced without doing much for it; it blindly assumes
 * that a ctlkey is a random binary string, which means that it will be
 * evenly scattered on average.  This is an explanation of why this registry
 * is lazy, and makes no extra effort to achieve balancing.
 *
 * The caller is expected to allocate (on its stack, presumably) a structure
 * for the administration of nodes in this tree.  Each node can have up to
 * 16 references to further details.  Leaf nodes can be NULL, which signals
 * that the stored pthread_t is the value sought.  Note that there is no such
 * thing as an invalid pthread_t 
 *
 * Finally, ctlkey values must be unique, which is normally the case when
 * 16 bytes are generated randomly.  The theoretic chance of a clash is
 * dealt with by reporting back an error.  With 16 bytes or 32 nibbles,
 * there are at most 32 levels of 16 branches in the ctlkeynode, and the
 * equality at 32 levels means that a clash was found.
 *
