/* tlspool/localid.h -- Map the keys of local identities to credentials */


/*
 * Lookup local identities from a BDB database.  The identities take the
 * form of a NAI, and are the keys for a key-values lookup.  The outcome
 * may offer multiple values, each representing an identity.  The general
 * structure of a value is:
 *
 * - 4 netbytes, a flags field for local identity management (see LID_xxx below)
 * - NUL-terminated string with a pkcs11 URI [ draft-pechanec-pkcs11uri ]
 * - Binary string holding the identity in binary form
 *
 * There may be prefixes for generic management, but these are not made
 * available to this layer.
