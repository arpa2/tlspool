/*
 * TLS Pool communication proceeds over a UNIX file system socket, by
 * sending and receiving messages like below.
 *
 * The order of events is always one where the application connecting
 * to the socket sends messages, and the TLS Pool always sends a response.
 * Depending on the command, this response may be fast or slow, but there
 * will always be a response as long as the connection is kept open.  If
 * the application can handle concurrent communication, it may send
 * more than one packet at a time.  The response will always copy the
 * pio_reqid field from the request to facilitate this; the application
 * should ensure different pio_reqid values for simultaneously sent
 * requests.  The TLS Pool may also request follow-up action, which
 * should also lead to exactly one action.  In this case, the pio_cbid
 * field must be copied into the new request.
 *
 * Command tags are 32 bit in size; this gives us the room to include
 * version numbers for semantic variations.  Implementations have the
 * freedom to combine similar tags (usually different versions) into
 * one piece of code.  Something counts as a version when its code has
 * been released into a code version; this does not include loose patches
 * or sheer uploads to a file system or mailing list.  Authors of new
 * versions are kindly requested to request an update to this file on its
 * prime location, http://github.com/vanrein/tlspool so it can serve as
 * a global registry, ensuring portability.
 * TODO: Consider changing to git.vanrein.org
 *
 * Commands would normally be deprecated for some time, i.e. recognised
 * but not sent.  After "sufficient time" has passed, a depracated tag
 * may be retracted from an implementation.  Instant retraction should
 * only be exercised under full control of all components, or for reasons
 * of urgency; notably, in case of security errors of the semantics (not
 * the coding) of a command tag.  This would effectively force other
 * components to upgrade -- but this is something to be careful about;
 * such upgrades should be readily available to all targeted users!
 *
 * It is generally safe to assume that applications need no protection
 * from the TLS Pool.  The opposite does not hold, as there are secrets
 * in the pool that may be interesting to attack.
 *
 * When a command fails, an error must always be reported through the
 * PIOC_ERROR_Vx command.  This is the only alternative to the usual
 * response, which may be PIOC_SUCCESS_Vx command or something defined
 * by the command to incorporate response data.
 *
 * Minute variations in commands should not be signaled with different
 * tags; instead, a flags field should be created in the payload.  This
 * is the more extensible approach.  Unknown flags are reserved for future
 * use and must always be set to zero when sending, and ignored when
 * receiving.  Such future extensions are always optional; a required
 * change would be implemented through a new semantics version.
 *
 * TODO: There may be extra pieces of information, notably the sending
 * of file descriptors is used to pass connections between processes.

/* An error packet is sent if the other party is unwilling to continue
 * the current exchange.  It explains why, through a code and message,
 * in the pioc_error type.  Error codes are defined in <errno.h> or
 * the are generated from error tables with compile_et, part of the
 * com_err suite.  The use of com_err is to merge ranges of error
 * codes from a variety of sources.
 *
 * We no longer support values other than valid int32_t values in the
 * integer field.  We never used that either, since we focussed on
 * values taken from <errno.h>.  We make this explicit because we
 * intend to focus on embedded systems, and although DER can pack any
 * INTEGER size, we want to limit what these systems need to handle
 * to what is usable for us and practical for them.
 *
 * Similar to this range limit, com_err was conceived in 1989, when
 * 32-bit integers were called long and when (apparently) int32_t
 * integers were not heard of.  The specification is clear however,
 * that error tables need 3 or 4 character names and produce error
 * codes with a table code in the top 24 bits and a code within the
 * error range in the bottom 8 bits.  This still works today; there
 * are 16,777,215 (not counting range 0 which is reserved for POSIX
 * errors from <errno.h>) and the risk of clashes is only 50% when
 * more than 4000 libraries are merged in one application.
 *
 * The limit also makes it possible to move values without loss,
 * tlserrno <- errno <- tlserrno <- errno <- ...
 *
 * Note that we are storing values in errno that cannot be resolved
 * with strerror() or perror() but that require their substitutes
 * error_message() and com_err() from the com_err suite.
 *
 * Finally, any POSIX error codes unequal to 0, usually in the range
 * 1..255, are generated locally.  The TLS Pool no longer generates
 * these codes, in light of upcoming support for remote access.

 *

 * and sent back in the same message format.  The remoteid is sent
 * by the TLS Pool as extra information, but it is an empty string if
 * the information is unavailable.
 *
 * Various sources may supply a local identity; it may arrive in a

/* Generate a pseudo-random sequence based on session cryptographic keys.

 * This leans on access privileges to an existing connection at a meta-level,
 * for which we use the customary ctlkey verification mechanism.  Note that
 * random material may be used for security purposes, such as finding the
 * same session key for both sides deriving from prior key negotiation; the
 * protection of a ctlkey for such applications is important.
 *
 * This command provides a struct pioc_prng holding the following information:
 *  - in1_len, in2_len hold lengths < 255 with input strings
 *  - buffer holds the ctlkey and then in1_len + in2_len bytes of input data
 *  - negative values in in1_len and/or in2_len suppress that field
 *  - prng_len holds the requested number of pseudo-random bytes
 *
 * If the operation succeeds, a struct_pioc_prng is returned holding:
 *  - prng_len holds the provided number of pseudo-random bytes
 *  - buffer holds these bytes (and has overwritten the rest of the buffer)
 *
 * The RFC 5705 implementation for TLS specifically uses:
 *  - in1_len is the length of the exporter label
 *  - in2_len is negative for no context or it is a context length
 *
 * Note a few restrictions to the generality of this operation:
 *  - it limits the input sizes
 *  - it limits the retrievable pseuo-random data to a prefix
 *
 * The TLS Pool may limit certain TLS PRNG labels, in adherence to the
 * IANA-maintained TLS Exporter Label Registry.  It additionally supports
 * the EXPERIMENTAL label prefix specified in RFC 5705.
 *
 * Be advised that the size of buffer may increase in future releases.  So,
 * be sure to use TLSPOOL_PRNGBUFLEN which holds the header-file defined size.

/* Exchange information about the connection, usually representative

 *
 * The kind of information is a constant PIOK_INFO_xxx as defined

 * The pioc_info structure that holds the information contains not

 * The info_len can be set to ~0 to indicate that the field must
 * be considered absent.  This is not the same as setting the length
 * to zero, which might indicate that an empty string is defined.
 * If you want to ask for information, set info_len to ~0; if you
 * want to check a value, set info_len to a lower value, perhaps 0.
 * A check will report an error, while a query would deliver a

/*************************** PIOF_LIDENTRY_xxx FLAGS **************************/


/* The flags below set the behaviour while searching the disclose.db for entries
 * that map a remote identity to a list of local identities.  It indicates which
 * values may be passed without interaction by the LIDENTRY extension; by
 * default, the registration of a LIDENTRY extension implies that all attempts
 * to determine a local identity pass through the extension; the _SKIP_ flags
 * indicate which entries may be implicitly skipped when they *all* apply.
 *
 * PIOF_LIDENTRY_SKIP_USER indicates that part of the skip condition is that
 * any username is not removed; variants with just a domain name are also
 * considered skippable under this flag;
 *
 * PIOF_LIDENTRY_SKIP_DOMAIN_xxx indicates whether the domain may be changed;
 * use _SAME and/or _ONEUP to indicate 0 and 1 levels up from the concrete
 * domain name; the _SUB variation combines _SAME and _ONEUP.
 *
 * PIOF_LIDENTRY_SKIP_NOTROOT indicates that the entry must not be the root
 * domain entry; whether or not the username is removed is not of influence
 * on the meaning of this flag.
 *
 * PIOF_LIDENTRY_SKIP_DBENTRY indicates that the entry must be in the database;
 * it is implied by all the above, but has meaning when used on its own, as it
 * permits skipping anything that is stored, without further restricting flags.
 *
 * These flags are used while registering a LIDENTRY extension; they are also
 * returned in callbacks, where they refer to the remote identity selector.
 * For example, _SKIP_USER indicates that the username part was skipped, and
 * _SKIP_DOMAIN_ONEUP indicates that the domain name goes one up.
 *
 * Although the skip selection could be made in the extension, it is less
 * efficient that way; the interaction with the extension is forced into a
 * sequence, and concurrent contenders may therefore need to wait for the
 * extension while it is interacting with the user.  So, skipping user
 * interaction when it is not needed is advantageous.  When skipping, the
 * disclose.db is used as a source, as if the LIDENTRY extension was not
 * registered at all.

 * by default, but that will be done when PIOF_LIDENTRY_DBREORDER is set.

 *
 * These on-the-fly identities will disappear when the TLS Pool restarts, and

 * although temporary caching may be used to improve efficiency.  In general,
 * do not rely on the same certificate to stay available.  Also, do not expect
 * public visibility of this identity in LDAP, DNS, or other identity showcase.
 *
 * Note that it should be assumed that these identities require special setup
 * in the remote node; if it is a full-blown TLS Pool, it will not appreciate
 * the locality of the identity, and demand more infrastructural confirmation
 * in identity showcases.  One example of its use however, is towards lame
 * and old-fashioned remote services and towards highly structured local users,
 * such as off-the-shelve browsers that require a HTTPS proxy.
