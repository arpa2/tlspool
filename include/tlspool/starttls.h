/* The library function for starttls, which is normally called through one
 * of the two inline variations below, which start client and server sides.
 *
 * The cryptfd handle supplies the TLS connection that is assumed to have
 * been setup.  When the function ends, either in success or failure, this
 * handle will no longer be available to the caller; the responsibility of
 * closing it is passed on to the function and/or the TLS Pool.
 *
 * The tlsdata structure will be copied into the command structure,
 * and upon completion it will be copied back.  You can use it to
 * communicate flags, protocols and other parameters, including the
 * most important settings -- local and remote identifiers.  See
 * the socket protocol document for details.
 *
 * The privdata handle is used in conjunction with the namedconnect() call;
 * it is passed on to connect the latter to the context from which it was
 * called and is not further acted upon by this function.
 *
 * The namedconnect() function is called when the identities have been
 * exchanged, and established, in the TLS handshake.  This is the point
 * at which a connection to the plaintext side is needed, and a callback
 * to namedconnect() is made to find a handle for it.  The function is
 * called with a version of the tlsdata that has been updated by the
 * TLS Pool to hold the local and remote identities.  The return value
 * should be -1 on error, with errno set, or it should be a valid file
 * handle that can be passed back to the TLS Pool to connect to.
 *
 * When the namedconnect argument passed is NULL, default behaviour is
 * triggered.  This interprets the privdata handle as an (int *) holding
 * a file descriptor.  If its value is valid, that is, >= 0, it will be
 * returned directly; otherwise, a socketpair is constructed, one of the
 * sockets is stored in privdata for use by the caller and the other is
 * returned as the connected file descriptor for use by the TLS Pool.
 * This means that the privdata must be properly initialised for this
 * use, with either -1 (to create a socketpair) or the TLS Pool's
 * plaintext file descriptor endpoint.  The file handle returned in
 * privdata, if it is >= 0, should be closed by the caller, both in case
 * of success and failure.
 *
 * This function returns zero on success, and -1 on failure.  In case of
 * failure, errno will be set.

/* Register a callback function for local identity selection with the
 * LIDENTRY API of the TLS Pool.  This will invoke the callback with zero
 * or more database entries (marked with flag PIOF_LIDENTRY_DBENTRY) and an
 * inquiry (without that flag) to enter a local identity.  The callback is
 * expected to save the database entries in some sort of a menu structure
 * (or ignore it if it is not interested in them) and use them in the
 * selection process.  What it does precisely is up to the registered
 * application.
 *
 * The callback behaviour of the API can be influenced in various ways;
 * see the PIOF_LIDENTRY_xxx flags in <tlspool/commands.h> for details.
 * Some flags are used during registration and supplied in regflags,
 * some are used during callback and exchanged in the tlspool_command.
 *
 * The registration for callback terminates in the following situations:
 *  - the TLS Pool file handle is closed
 *  - the callback returns a wrong type of command, including PIOC_ERROR_xx
 *  - the callback does not respond fast enough (other apps may overtake)
 *
 * The responsetimeout is set to the number of seconds that a callback
 * may at most take to respond.  The claim on the registration will expire
 * after this time has passed.
 *
 * Note that the service function does not return until the callback
 * registration is terminated.  This is why it is called xxx_service and
 * not xxx_callback.  You may want to use a thread if your intention is
 * to do other things as well.  Note however, that it is usually a good
 * idea to keep localid handling separate, as a GUI function, from the
 * other components that interact with the TLS Pool for other purposes,
 * such as wrapping an application protocol.
 *
 * This function returns 0 on success, meaning it has gotten to a stage
 * where it was registered with the TLS Pool.  Otherwise, it returns -1
 * and sets errno.

 * with the TLS Pool and will service callback requests until it is no
 * longer welcomed.  Of course, if another process already has a claim on
 * this functionality, the service offering will not be welcome from the
 * start.
 *
 * This function differs from most other TLS Pool library functions in
 * setting up a private socket.  This helps to avoid the overhead in the
 * foreseeable applications that only do this; it also helps to close
 * down the exclusive claim on local identity resolution when (part of)
 * the program is torn down.  The function has been built to cleanup
 * properly when it is subjected to pthread_cancel().
 *
 * The path parameter offers a mechanism to specify the socket path.  When
 * set to NULL, the library's compiled-in default path will be used.
 *
 * In terms of linking, this routine is a separate archive object.  This
 * minimizes the amount of code carried around in statically linked binaries.
 *
 * This function returns -1 on error, or 0 on success.

/* Generate a pseudo-random sequence based on session cryptographic keys.
 *
 * In the case of TLS, this adheres to RFC 5705; other protocols may or
 * may not support a similar mechanism, in which case an error is returned.
 *
 * This leans on access privileges to an existing connection at a meta-level,
 * for which we use the customary ctlkey verification mechanism introduced with
 * tlspool_starttls ().  Note that random material may be used for security
 * purposes, such as finding the same session key for both sides deriving from
 * prior key negotiation; the protection of a ctlkey for such applications is
 * important.
 * 
 * The inputs to this function must adhere to the following restrictions:
 *  - label must not be a NULL pointer, but opt_ctxvalue may be set to NULL
 *    to bypass the use of a context value.  Note that passing an empty string
 *    in opt_ctxvalue is different from not providing the string at all by
 *    setting it to NULL.
 *  - label  and  opt_ctxvalue  (if non-NULL) refer to ASCII strings with
 *    printable characters, terminated with a NUL character.  The maximum
 *    string length of each is 254 bytes.
 *  - prng_len holds the requested number of pseudo-random bytes
 *  - prng_buf points is a non-NULL pointer to a buffer that can hold
 *    prng_len bytes.
 *
 * If the operation succeeds, then prng_buf holds prng_len bytes of random
 * material, and zero is returned.  If the operation fails, then prng_buf
 * is filled with zero bytes (to make it stand out as a rather rare case of
 * a random byte string) and -1 is returned.
 *
 * Note a few restrictions to the generality of this function, as a result of
 * the underlying packet format for the communication with the TLS Pool; but
 * the dimensions have been choosen such that these restrictions would not
 * typically be a problem in practice:
 *  - it constrains the string lengths of label and opt_ctxvalue
 *  - it constrains prng_len to a maximum value of TLSPOOL_PRNGBUFLEN
 *
 * The TLS Pool may limit certain TLS PRNG labels, in adherence to the
 * IANA-maintained TLS Exporter Label Registry.  It additionally supports
 * the EXPERIMENTAL label prefix specified in RFC 5705.
 *
 * Be advised that the maximum size of buffer may increase in future releases.
 * So, be sure to use TLSPOOL_PRNGBUFLEN which holds the header-file defined
 * size.

 * provide it to any query) and to E_TLSPOOL_INFO_NOT_FOUND when the
