#TLS POOL COPYRIGHT AND LICENSING

TLS pool is **Copyright 2013-2019 Rick van Rein, the ARPA2.net project.**

The TLS Pool is open source software; its licensing lets you use it freely, but for the daemon you are obliged to share source code, and publish any modifications.

The user space tools, libraries and include files are licensed under a BSD-style license, included in [LICENSE-USERSPACE.MD](LICENSE-USERSPACE.MD), which gives its users maximum freedom to use it as they see fit, and to link the libraries to code using various other licenses, including in closed-source.

The TLS Pool daemon code is licensed under GPL version 3, included as [LICENSE-DAEMON.MD](LICENSE-DAEMON.MD); if you prefer a later GPL version then please contact us.  The GPL does not apply to other processes, so the strict licensing of the daemon does not pass over to applications using it.

Documentation included with the TLS Pool falls under a Creative Commons license, included as [LICENSE-DOCS.MD](LICENSE-DOCS.MD).  The license allows you to republish with or without adaptions, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as you give appropriate credit and share under the same conditions: CC BY-SA 4.0 International.

You must accurately reference the source code version used for your binary release, and you must update your source code references whenever you release updated binaries.  The suggested form of publishing (modified) source code is in a Git repository that builds on a public release channel of the TLS Pool.  The SHA1 hash assigned to each revision is a straightforward manner of identifying the source code that goes with each binary in use.

We are always happy to receive improvements that are of general use and that have been well-designed; please talk to us if you would like to include your work into the mainstream Git repositories.
