.TH TLSPOOL_SOCKET 3 "November 2015" "ARPA2.net" "Library Calls"
.SH NAME
tlspool_socket \- Setup the TLS Pool to use with a given socket path.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <tlspool/commands.h>
.br
.B #include <tlspool/starttls.h>
.sp
.B int tlspool_socket (char *\fIpath\fB);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR tlspool_socket ()
returns a file descriptor for the TLS Pool.  During the first call, the
.I path
argument is used as a path to the UNIX domain socket to use; during later
calls, the argument is ignored but the returned file descriptor is instead
the same one as before.  A NULL value for the argument is replaced with
the value of the
.BR socket_name configuration
file as returned by
.IR tlspool_configvar()
or, if that fails, the statically compiled value in
.BR TLSPOOL_DEFAULT_SOCKET_PATH .
.PP
All of the
.IR tlspool_XXX ()
functions that do not have a socket path argument
call this function internally, to setup a shared access point
to the TLS Pool.  In addition, a "master thread" is created to retrieve
and redistribute return values.  This mechanism facilitates multiple
simultaneous commands being sent to the TLS Pool by independent threads.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The function returns a file descriptor >= 0 on success.
If an error occurs, the function returns -1 and
.I errno
is set appropriately.

.PP
The configuration file option
.I socket_name
influences the path at which the TLS Pool is available; this is not
read by the client library, and when it differs from the default path in
.BR TLSPOOL_DEFAULT_SOCKET_PATH ,
this function is used to inform the client library once, before calling
any of the other client functions.

.IR <tlspool/commands.h> " and " <tlspool/starttls.h>
for C, and the
.I tlspool.py
module for Python.
